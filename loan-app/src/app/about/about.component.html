            Just recently they have added a new loan calculator to their web site. This calculator will allow customers to enter details on a loan such as the loan amount,
            interest rate, and number of years and the calculator will give you a monthly payment as well as the amount of interest that will be paid over the life of the loan.

            I donâ€™t know much about the different houses, I chose House Ravenclaw because I liked their colors and what they represented. Taken from the page of the
            Harry Potter Wiki, https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ravenclaw, here is a bit of backstory to House Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch, Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterized by their wit, learning,
            and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colors. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady,
            real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.
